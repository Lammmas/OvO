### Guidance:
- Approach the exercise as if you’re building the application for production. How would you ensure
a high quality, maintainable solution?
- As a rough guide it should take around 2-3 hours, but feel free to spend a bit more time to
create a solution you’re happy with.
- Include a sentence or two on how you approached the problem and what you’d improve, given
more time.
- Simple, clear solutions are perfectly acceptable. There’s no need to over-engineer.
- Please include instructions on how to run the application and tests.
